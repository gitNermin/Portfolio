            <li>
                Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of our app per device for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
                    <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
                    <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in our app;</li>
                    <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
                    <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
